## Features
It performs the following tasks automatically:
- Converts and renames items and folders to match newer structures.
- Updates the 'pack_format' so Minecraft can recognize the new version.
- Removes fake transparent pixels from items (helps with 3D appearance in high-res packs).
- From version 1.11+, it generates left and right offhand hotbars from the original one.
- If you're updating a 1.8.9 pack, it will also generate Netherite items.

→ You can also drag and drop multiple ZIP packs at once — they will be processed automatically.
